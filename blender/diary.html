            How I learned to use Blender

            <p>
                Here's some sort of diary of me learning to use <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.
                <br>
                This is not some sort of 30 day challenge, this is me in it for the long haul. And this means taking some healthy 
                breaks in between days. That's why i started in August 2020 but have only worked for a few days up until now. Life happens and it's ok
                to take breaks, but it's important to keep going.

                1: Basic functionality, following Blender Gurus donut tutorial
            </p>
            <p>
                2: more donut - it looks horrible, but i was so proud i made this thing!

                4: written a cheatsheet, available on <a href="https://github.com/pantaire/ncaseplaite/blob/master/blender/cheatsheet.md">github</a> and <a href="/blender/cheatsheet.md">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                5: rendered a low poly planet, later added some trees

                6: laptop died, had to pause for quite some time
            </p>
            <p>
                7: tried modeling a human basemesh. failed.
            </p>
            <p>
                8: tried <i>sculpting</i> a human basemesh. gave up after some time.
            </p>
            <p>
                9: rigged a downloaded human basemesh. failed several times but learned a lot and finally had my first rig to play around with.
                in the end.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                12: started modeling Mia Wallace (a human!) from 1 reference image. head (except eyelids and hair) is
                sculpted.
            </p>
            <p>
