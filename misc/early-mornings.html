			<h3>the rules</h3>
            This started when i watched some of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ellie.breeden">@ellie.breeden</a>'s reels. 
            You might have heard of her, she's the girl who gets up earlier than usual in the morning and does things such as hiking in an evening gown to fight for her mental health.
            Ya girl was impressed and started writing things down i wanted to do if i had the time. 
            After a few hours, i had accumulated 40 actions, i wanted to tackle in the following few weeks. 
            The goal is to get them done - preferably in the morning, but as of day 4, i have done some of them in the evening before because i was too hyped to wait till morning. 
            Ideally, every evening i would pick the action for the next morning by drawing a random number and preparing the things necessary. 
            Here is how it went.

            <h3>day 1: take a photo of the sunrise</h3>
            well, this was fairly easy since the sun is rising at 7:30 at this time of the year. still did it tho, but it felt kind of underwhelming since 7:30 is ... not really early.
            
			<h3>day 2: weeding out github</h3>
            Things were getting out of hand and since 90% of my repositories are public on <a href="https:github.com/pantaire">Github</a>, i decided this needed a clean up. 
            I started with over 20 not really used repos, and ended up with about 10 i really needed. Some of them are archived and read-only, since i might use them for future reference.
			Sure, there will be more in the future for other projects, but for now this is enough.
			<br>
			Also, this was when i accidentally created a frankenrepo by trying to combine multiple repositories into one and failing massively. But i was able to fix it.
			<br>
            I must admit i did this the evening before, so... day 3 will be on the second day of this project to get me out of bed.
            <h3>day 3: deleting unused accounts</h3>
